# GroundCalc

A pretty cool grounding grid calculator.

This tool enables the user to carry out simplified grounding studies involving arbitrary grids and two-layered soils, using the microsegmentation method proposed by Dawalibi et al. It is possible to perform simulations using the good-ol' equipotential assumption, as well as accounting for the internal impedances of conductors.

The main technical highlights are:
- Intuitive, self-explaining UI, which requires a minimum of data entry.
- Ability to load conductor coordinates from CSV or TXT files, including AutoCAD data extractions and DXF files.
- Calculates grounding resistance, GPR, leakage currents, touch voltage and step voltage distributions.
- Calculates safe limits according to IEEE Std. 80.
- Interactive plot control and grid preview.
