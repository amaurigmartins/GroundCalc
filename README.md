# GroundCalc

Made for educational purposes, GroundCalc enables the user to carry out simplified (but not that much) grounding studies involving arbitrary grids and two-layered soils, using the microsegmentation method proposed by Dawalibi et al. It is possible to perform simulations using the good-ol' equipotential assumption, as well as accounting for the internal impedances of conductors.

The main technical highlights are:
- Intuitive, self-explaining UI, which requires a minimum of data entry.
- Ability to load conductor coordinates from CSV or TXT files, including AutoCAD data extractions and DXF files.
- Calculates grounding impedance, GPR, leakage currents, touch voltage and step voltage distributions.
- Calculates safe limits according to IEEE Std. 80.
- It is possible to specify the point where the fault is applied and the neutral return point. 
- Interactive plot control and grid preview.

### Disclaimer

This is not a professional power grounding simulation tool. The takeaway here is to put in perspective the design errors that may occur when overly simplified methods are adopted, in particular when conductor impedances and neutral return currents are neglected. The equations and methods implemented are fairly accurate for small to medium sized geometries at the mains frequency and that's all. DO NOT USE THIS FOR A REAL DESIGN. Go use CDEGS instead. Do not use spaghetti-copycat-generic-cheap software either. This is about human lifes, for God's sake.
