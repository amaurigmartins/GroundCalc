# GroundCalc
A very simple grounding grid calculator for didactic purposes.

This tool enables the user to carry out simplified grounding studies involving arbitrary grids and two-layered soils, based on an equipotential assumption and using the microsegmentation method proposed by Dawalibi et al.

The main technical highlights are:
- Intuitive, self-explaining UI, which requires a minimum of data entry.
- Ability to load conductor coordinates from CSV or TXT files, including AutoCAD data extractions.
- Calculates grounding resistance, GPR, touch voltage and step voltage distributions.
- Calculates safe limits according to IEEE Std. 80.
- Interactive plot control.
